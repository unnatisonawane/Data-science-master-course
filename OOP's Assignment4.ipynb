    "     suppose we want to create a Vehicle class. What information would we associate with a vehicle, and what behavior would it have? A vehicle may have a type, brand, model and so on. This type of information is stored in python variables called attributes. These things also have behaviors. A Vehicle can drive, stop, honk its horn, and so on. Behaviors are contained in functions and a function that is part of a class is called a method.\n"
