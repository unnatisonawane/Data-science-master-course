    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes two arguments: the path to the file (either relative or absolute), and the mode in which the file should be opened. The mode argument is optional and if it is not specified, the file is opened in read-only mode by default.\n",

    "Here are the different modes of opening a file in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' - read-only mode: This is the default mode for opening a file. It allows you to read the contents of the file but not modify them. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' - write mode: This mode allows you to write to the file. If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' - append mode: This mode allows you to append new data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' - exclusive creation mode: This mode creates a new file and opens it for writing. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' - binary mode: This mode is used when working with binary files like images, audio, or video. It is used in conjunction with any of the above modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' - text mode: This mode is used when working with text files. It is the default mode if the mode argument is not specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "'+' - read and write mode: This mode allows you to both read and write to a file. It is used in conjunction with any of the above modes.\n",
    "\n",
