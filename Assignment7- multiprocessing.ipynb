    "4. Multiple threads can run on different CPU cores, but they share the same memory and resources.\n",
    "5. Threads can communicate with each other more easily and directly using shared data.\n",
    "6. However, due to the shared memory space, multithreading requires careful synchronization to avoid data races and other concurrency issues.\n",
    "7. Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the parallel execution of multiple threads in CPython, the default Python interpreter. Therefore, multithreading in Python may not achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiprocessing is the execution of multiple processes, each running independently.\n",
    "2. Processes have their own separate memory space and resources.\n",
    "3. Multiprocessing is suitable for tasks that involve CPU-bound operations, such as complex computations.\n",
    "4. Each process runs on a separate CPU core, providing true parallelism.\n",
    "5. Processes communicate with each other using interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, shared memory, or message queues.\n",
    "6. Communication between processes is more explicit and requires serialization of data.\n",
    "7. Multiprocessing in Python overcomes the limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and enables true parallel execution of multiple processes.\n",
