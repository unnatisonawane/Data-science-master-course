    "SQL Database: \n",
    "1. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas.\n",
    "2. They use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating data. \n",
    "3. SQL databases are based on the relational model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "4. They ensure data integrity through constraints, enforce relationships between tables through keys, and support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.\n",
    "5. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Database:\n",
    "1. NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that provide a flexible and scalable approach to storing and managing data.\n",
    "2. They do not require a fixed schema and can handle unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "3. NoSQL databases offer high scalability and performance by distributing data across multiple nodes. \n",
    "4. They support horizontal scaling, handle large volumes of data, and are often used in big data and real-time applications\n",
    "5. NoSQL databases come in various types, such as document stores, key-value stores, columnar databases, and graph databases.\n",
    "6. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j."
